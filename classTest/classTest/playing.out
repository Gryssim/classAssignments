Object has w = 1 l = 2
Object has w = 2 l = 4

Step 3A - Use new constructors with new variables and print

the playClass1 object has : length = 6.235 width = 4.375
the playClass1 object has : length = 12.725 width = 10

Step 3B - Create new double var Area and print for 'x' and 'y'.

'x' has area : 27.2781
'y' has area : 127.25

Step 3C- Change the dimensions of 'a' and print the area.

'a' has area : 55.0045

Step3D - Change the dimensons of 'b' and print the area.

'b' has area : 105.765
